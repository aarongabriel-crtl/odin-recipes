        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Put the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the suet, currants, sugar, lemon and orange zest.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Pour in 150ml milk and mix to a firm but moist dough, adding the extra milk if necessary.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Shape into a fat roll about 20cm long. Place on a large rectangle of baking parchment. Wrap loosely to allow for the pudding to rise and tie the ends with string like a Christmas cracker.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Place a steamer over a large pan of boiling water, add the pudding to the steamer, cover and steam for 1Â½ hours. Top up the pan with water from time to time.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Remove from the steamer and allow to cool slightly before unwrapping. Serve sliced with custard.</p></li>
